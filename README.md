# Project Intro
This code tests the hypothesis that suggests "University towns in the US are less affected by recessions" by running a T-Test
# Data used
-From the Zillow research data site there is housing data for the United States. In particular the datafile for all homes at a city 
level, City_Zhvi_AllHomes.csv, has median home sale prices at a fine grained level.

-From the Wikipedia page on college towns is a list of university towns in the United States which has been copy and pasted into the file university_towns.txt.

-From Bureau of Economic Analysis, US Department of Commerce, the GDP over time of the United States in current dollars (use the chained value in 2009 dollars), in quarterly intervals, in the file gdplev.xls. For this assignment, only look at GDP data from the first quarter of 2000 onward.
